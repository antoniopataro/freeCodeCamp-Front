# freeCodeCamp's Front-End Projects

This repository is meant to save my projects made for freeCodeCamp in their Front-End free course.
I used React for all five projects. 🔥

### ⏰ The last project

A quick note about the last project: The clock is lacking in two tests, what I gave up trying to fix since they're false. Feel free to create for on CodePen and try to fix it (and explaing it to me, please)! 😅
